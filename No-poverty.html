            <h1>Why should I care about other people’s economic situation?</h1>
            <p>
              There are many reasons, but in short, because as human beings, our
              wellbeing is linked to each other. Growing inequality is
              detrimental to economic growth and undermines in risk of being
              pushed back into extreme poverty - people living on less than
              $1.90/day - causing the first increase in global poverty in more
              than 20 years. Even before COVID-19, baseline projections
              suggested that 6 per cent of the global population would still be
              living in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the target of ending
              poverty. Developing countries will face a devastating social and
              economic crisis over the months and years to social cohesion,
              increasing political and social tensions and, in some
              circumstances, driving instability and conflicts.

            <h1>Why End Poverty?</h1>
            <p>
              In 2015, more than 700 million people, or 10 per cent of the world
              <br />
              population, lived in extreme poverty, struggling to fulfil the
              most
              <br />
              basic needs like health, education, and access to water and
              sanitation,
              <br />
              to name a few. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is reversing the
              trend of
              <br />
              poverty reduction with tens of millions of people in risk of being
              <br />
              pushed back into extreme poverty - people living
              <br />
              on less than $1.90/day - causing the first increase in global
              <br />
              poverty in more than 20 years. Even before COVID-19, baseline
              <br />

              <br />
              would still be living in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the
              target of ending poverty. <br />
              <br />
              Developing countries will face a devastating social and economic
              crisis over the months and years
              <br />
              to come, with the pandemic pushing millions of workers into
              <br />
              underemployment and working poverty. Having a job also does not
              <br />
              guarantee a decent living. In fact, 7.1 per cent of employed
              workers and
              <br />

              their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2019, a
              positive
              <br />

              decline compared to 2010, but the number is expected to rise in
              light of
              <br />

              the long-term consequences of the pandemic

            <p>
              The COVID-19 pandemic will have both immediate and long-term
              economic consequences for people across the globe. Strong social
              protection systems are essential for mitigating the effects and
              preventing many people from falling into poverty. Nevertheless, 55
              per cent of the world’s population – about 4 billion people – did
              not benefit from any form of social protection in 2016. Only 22
              per cent of unemployed workers were covered by unemployment
              benefits.

          <p>
            Your active engagement in policymaking can make a difference in
            addressing poverty. It ensures that your rights are promoted and
            that your voice is heard, that intergenerational knowledge is
            shared, and that innovation and critical thinking are encouraged at
            all ages to support transformational change in people’s lives and
            communities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Governments can help create an enabling environment to generate
            productive employment and job opportunities for the poor and the
            marginalized.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The private sector has a major role to play in determining whether
            the growth it creates is inclusive and contributes to poverty
            reduction. It can promote economic opportunities for the poor.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The contribution of science to end poverty has been significant. For
            example, it has enabled access to safe drinking water, reduced
            deaths caused by water-borne diseases, and improved hygiene to
            reduce health risks related to unsafe drinking water and lack of
            sanitation
