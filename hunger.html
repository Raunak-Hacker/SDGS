            <h1>Why are there so many hungry people?</h1>
            <p>
              Along with conflict, climate shocks and the locust crisis, the
              pandemic poses an additional threat to food systems. Civil
              insecurity and declining food production have all contributed to
              food scarcity and high food prices. Investment in the agriculture
              sector is critical for reducing hunger and poverty, improving food
              security, creating employment and building resilience to disasters
              and shocks

            <h1>Why No Hunger?</h1>
            <p>
              Extreme hunger and malnutrition remains a barrier to sustainable
              development and creates a trap from which people cannot easily
              escape. Hunger and malnutrition mean less productive individuals,
              who are more prone to disease and thus often unable to earn more
              and improve their livelihoods. 2 billion people in the world do
              not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food.
              In 2019, 144 million children under the age of 5 were stunted, and
              47 million were affected by wasting.

            <p>
              We all want our families to have enough food to eat what is safe
              and nutritious. A world with zero hunger can positively impact our
              economies, health, education, equality and social development.
              It’s a key piece of building a better future for everyone.
              Additionally, with hunger limiting human development, we will not
              be able to achieve the other sustainable development goals such as
              education, health and gender equality.

            <h1>How can we achieve zero hunger?</h1>
            <p>
              Food security requires a multi-dimensional approach – from social
              protection to safeguard safe and nutritious food especially for
              children - to transforming food systems to achieve a more
              inclusive and sustainable world. There will need to be investments
              in rural and urban areas and in social protection so poor people
              have access to food and can improve their livelihoods.

                The private sector has a major role to play in determining
                whether the growth it creates is inclusive and contributes to
                poverty reduction. It can promote economic opportunities for the
                poor.
